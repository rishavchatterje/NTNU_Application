# NTNU_Application
This is a repository made especially for submitting the solution of NTNU P.h.D Assignment

We would be discussing the solution to the Ethereum Task :

1. We need to select the Test Net according to our choice. It could be either of Ropsten, Kovan or Rinkeby.
2. We connect it then by using Metamask. We can choose it easily over there.

Geth has a function named web3.eth.getBalance() to find the balance of the contract ........ (after the contract has been deployed)
